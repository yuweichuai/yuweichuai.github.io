Thank you for visiting my personal webite. I am a thrid-year PhD student at the University of Luxembourg (started from October 2022) and a member of [IRISC](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/research-groups/IRiSC/) research group at Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT). My research interests are in `Social Networks`, `Misinformation`, and `Computational Social Science`.

Currently, I am working on a research project titled `REMEDIS` -- [REgulatory Solutions to MitigatE online DISinfomation](https://projectremedis.wordpress.com/) -- funded by FNR in Luxembourg. My work in understanding and combating the spread of online misinformation has been accepted/published in high-quality journals and conferences, such as `CSCW`. Part of my findings was also featured by popular media such as `New Scientist`, `Poynter` and `Communications of the ACM`.
